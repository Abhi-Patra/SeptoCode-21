# **Septocode 21**

Hello Everyone!

**Septocode 21** is a 21 days programming event for students to develop basic programming skills which will be helpful to them while working in various domains in future while inculcating a habit to code daily.

Starting from 13th September, all the contributors will be provided with simple programming questions, **one per day**, which can be written using any programming language such as C/C++/Java/Python or any language of preference and will be submitted **every day**. The contributor has to submit the **code** and the **output** generated through **google forms** which will be accepted after **thorough checking**.



## Steps to Follow:

- Check the question of the day in the GitHub repository. (You may download the question or fork the repository)
- Download the test cases file.
- You can then start working on the question.

 ## Submission Guidelines
- A google form will be shared where the code file and output file is to be submitted on a daily basis.
- Make sure the code file and output files are in the .txt format.
- To generate the output file, follow the below instructions in the command prompt:
  
  **i.	For C/C++**

        c++/c:

        g++/gcc file.cpp -o file.exe

        file.exe < ip.txt > op.txt

  **ii.	For Java**

        java: 

        javac file.java 

        file.class < ip.txt > op.txt

  **iii.	For Python**
